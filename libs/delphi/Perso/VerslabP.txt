Status      : Freeware

Description:    TVersionLabel is a visual component that displays the
                information available through the Win32 file information
                routines.

Requirements:   Delphi 3.x, any edition

Installation:   Place the file verslab.pas with all your other installable
                components, and add it to the delphi palette as usual.

To Use:         Ensure the the Delphi 3 compiler is set to produce version
                information (Project/Options/VersionInfo tab) and place this
                component on the form to display the information at run time.

Licence:        Freeware code, do with it what you will. Just let me know if
                you find any bugs or you like it (or you don't like it!), or
                anything else really.

History:
    v1.01   : fixed bug stopping LangCharSet from actually doing anything
                at all on a non-UK system.

    v1.02   : Fixed resource leak bug. (surely there can't be any more? It's
                only 6K!) Thanks to Peter Stromblad for finding it!
                1 July 1997

    v1.03   : Added display of flags, tidied up code. Made LangCharSet
                autodetect. Thanks to Fabrice Marguerie
                (FabriceM@compuserve.com) for the flags code.

Extra Properties:
-------------------

property VersionResource: TVersionResources;
    This propery can set to display any one of 10 standard version info
    strings.
    TVersionResources = (vrCompanyName, vrFileDescription, vrFileVersion,
                         vrInternalName, vrLegalCopyright, vrOriginalFilename,
                         vrProductName, vrProductVersion, vrComments, vrFlags);

    If vrFlags is selected the VersionResourceKey property is ignored and the
    label displays the contents of the 'private build, special build' etc
    checkboxes in the D3 project options VersionInfo tab.

property VersionResourceKey: string;
    Set this to the name of the key that is to be returned with the
    GetFileVersionInfo call. If one of the 10 standard resource types are
    used this value is set automatically. If you insert a new (non-standard)
    key into the version resource table then set this property to the name
    of the key.

property InfoPrefix: String;
    Sets the text that is displayed in the label before the version
    information string.

property ShowInfoPrefix: boolean;
    If set, the InfoPrefix text will be prepended to the version information
    displayed. If false, only the version information will be displayed.

property LangCharSet: string;
    The API help says (and I quote):
    'Specifies a value in a language-specific structure. The lang-charset
    name is a concatenation of a language and character-set identifier pair
    found in the translation table for the resource. The lang-charset name
    must be specified as a hexadecimal string.'

    This defaults to -1, which means that the component will try to
    figure it out at run time. If you get errors, mail me but try the following
    guidelines as well:

    The first 4 digits of this string are the language code, defaulting to
    0809 for UK English. 0409 is US English, look up VerLanguageName for
    the others. The last 4 digits represent a code page and for most
    environments they should not be changed from the default of 04E4.
